"Based on the provided context, the reason you don't get an exact identity matrix when you invert a matrix and multiply by the original is due to floating point precision in computer calculations. Floating point math doesn't work well on computers, leading to small errors in the calculations.

A: linear regression is a pretty simple model, it neither can nor should fit 100% (nor any other model, as this would be the sign of overfitting). This picture might illustrate some intuition behind this, imagine X is a single feature:
As our model is linear, how would you draw a line to fit all the ""dots""?
You could ""fit"" all the ""dots"" on this pic using something like scipy.optimize.curve_fit (non-linear least squares) if you wanted to, but imagine how it would perform on previously unseen data.

The error 'could not convert string to float: Nissan' typically occurs when a machine learning model is trying to convert a categorical variable like 'Nissan' into a numerical value. This error happens when the model or function is expecting numerical input but receives a string instead. One way to resolve this issue is to encode categorical variables like car brands into numerical values using methods like one-hot encoding.,"The error message “could not convert string to float: ‘Nissan’” typically occurs when a machine learning model or function is expecting numerical input, but receives a string instead. In this case, it seems like the model is trying to convert the car brand ‘Nissan’ into a numerical value, which isn’t possible.
To resolve this issue, you can encode categorical variables like car brands into numerical values. One common method is one-hot encoding, which creates new binary columns for each category/label present in the original column.
Here’s an example of how you can perform one-hot encoding using pandas:
import pandas as pd
# Assuming 'data' is your DataFrame and 'brand' is the column with car brands
data_encoded = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['brand'])
In this code, pd.get_dummies() creates a new DataFrame where the ‘brand’ column is replaced with binary columns for each brand (e.g., ‘brand_Nissan’, ‘brand_Toyota’, etc.). Each row in the DataFrame has a 1 in the column that corresponds to its brand and 0 in all other brand columns.

Mutual information score is used only for categorical or discrete variables because it calculates the relationship between such variables. Continuous variables need to be changed to binary format to make their values discrete in order to calculate mutual information score effectively.,"Solution: Mutual Information score calculates the relationship between categorical variables or discrete variables. So in the homework, because the target which is median_house_value is continuous, we had to change it to binary format which in other words, makes its values discrete as either 0 or 1. If we allowed it to remain in the continuous variable format, the mutual information score could be calculated, but the algorithm would have to divide the continuous variables into bins and that would be highly subjective.

I had separate train() and predict() functions, which were reused after dividing the dataset via KFold. The model ran about 10 minutes and provided a good score.

Cross-validation is used when evaluating model performance to assess the model's performance and select the best hyperparameters. It involves splitting the dataset into multiple parts and training and evaluating the model multiple times with different folds as the validation set. This process helps in choosing the optimal hyperparameters for the model's performance.,"Cross-validation evaluates the performance of a model and chooses the best hyperparameters. Cross-validation does this by splitting the dataset into multiple parts (folds), typically 5 or 10. It then trains and evaluates your model multiple times, each time using a different fold as the validation set and the remaining folds as the training set.
""C"" is a hyperparameter that is typically associated with regularization in models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and logistic regression.
Smaller ""C"" values: They introduce more regularization, which means the model will try to find a simpler decision boundary, potentially underfitting the data. This is because it penalizes the misclassification of training examples more severely.
Larger ""C"" values: They reduce the regularization effect, allowing the model to fit the training data more closely, potentially overfitting. This is because it penalizes misclassification less severely, allowing the model to prioritize getting training examples correct.

"To resolve errors when installing sklearn version 1.0.2 in the virtual environment, you should use the full name ""scikit-learn"" instead of just ""sklearn"". Run the command as ""pipenv install scikit-learn==1.0.2"" and the error will be resolved, allowing you to install the specified version of sklearn in your virtual environment.","When the facilitator was adding sklearn to the virtual environment in the lectures, he used sklearn==0.24.1 and it ran smoothly. But while doing the homework and you are asked to use the 1.0.2 version of sklearn, it gives errors.
The solution is to use the full name of sklearn. That is, run it as “pipenv install scikit-learn==1.0.2” and the error will go away, allowing you to install sklearn for the version in your virtual environment.

The `--rm` flag is needed when running docker containers to avoid accumulating abandoned containers in your system. These abandoned containers consume extra space on disk and should be removed by using the `--rm` option to avoid cluttering your system.,"What is the reason we don’t want to keep the docker image in our system and why do we need to run docker containers with `--rm` flag?
For best practice, you don’t want to have a lot of abandoned docker images in your system. You just update it in your folder and trigger the build one more time.
They consume extra space on your disk. Unless you don’t want to re-run the previously existing containers, it is better to use the `--rm` option.
The right way to say: “Why do we remove the docker container in our system?”. Well the docker image is still kept; it is the container that is not kept. Upon execution, images are not modified; only containers are.
The option `--rm` is for removing containers. The images remain until you remove them manually. If you don’t specify a version when building an image, it will always rebuild and replace the latest tag. `docker images` shows you all the image you have pulled or build so far.
During development and testing you usually specify `--rm` to get the containers auto removed upon exit. Otherwise they get accumulated in a stopped state, taking up space. `docker ps -a` shows you all the containers you have in your host. Each time you change Pipfile (or any file you baked into the container), you rebuild the image under the same tag or a new tag. It’s important to understand the difference between the term “docker image” and “docker container”. Image is what we build with all the resources baked in. You can move it around, maintain it in a repository, share it. Then we use the image to spin up instances of it and they are called containers.

"Bagging, also known as ""Bootstrap Aggregation,"" involves training multiple models in parallel on different samples derived from the original training dataset through bootstrapping. The final prediction is made by combining the predictions of each model, either through voting for classification or averaging for regression. Bagging decreases variance and is robust against overfitting. On the other hand, boosting is a sequential method where each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights based on misclassifications, and the process continues until a stopping condition is met. Boosting reduces bias and is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.","For ensemble algorithms, during the week 6, one bagging algorithm and one boosting algorithm were presented: Random Forest and XGBoost, respectively.
Random Forest trains several models in parallel. The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.
XGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.
Note that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.

Bagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.
Boosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.

"If you encounter a ValueError about the channel dimension being None when reloading a saved model in TensorFlow, make sure to specify the number of channels explicitly in the Input layer of the model. You can do this by adjusting the code to specify the number of channels like this:

```python
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(input_size, input_size, 3))
```

By explicitly defining the number of channels in the Input layer, you will prevent the error related to the channel dimension being None when reloading the model.","While doing:
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('model_saved.h5')
If you get an error message like this:
ValueError: The channel dimension of the inputs should be defined. The input_shape received is (None, None, None, None), where axis -1 (0-based) is the channel dimension, which found to be `None`.
Solution:
Saving a model (either yourself via model.save() or via checkpoint when save_weights_only = False) saves two things: The trained model weights (for example the best weights found during training) and the model architecture.  If the number of channels is not explicitly specified in the Input layer of the model, and is instead defined as a variable, the model architecture will not have the value in the variable stored. Therefore when the model is reloaded, it will complain about not knowing the number of channels. See the code below, in the first line, you need to specify number of channels explicitly:
# model architecture:
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(input_size, input_size, 3))
base = base_model(inputs, training=False)
vectors = keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(base)
inner = keras.layers.Dense(size_inner, activation='relu')(vectors)

I found running the wasp/bee model on my mac laptop had higher reported accuracy and lower std deviation than the HW answers. This may be because of the SGD optimizer. Running this on my mac printed a message about a new and legacy version that could be used.

"The main difference between the Sequential Model API and the Functional Model API in Keras is the way in which the layers are added to the model. In the Sequential Model API, you can easily start with an empty model and add layers in a sequential order, which makes it easier to work with a sequence of similar layers. On the other hand, the Functional Model API allows for a more complicated way of implementing the model, which can be useful when doing Transfer Learning and separating different parts of the model.","It’s quite useful to understand that all types of models in the course are a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor (Sequential model TF page, Sequential class).
You can simply start from an “empty” model and add more and more layers in a sequential order.
This mode is called “Sequential Model API”  (easier)
In Alexey’s videos it is implemented as chained calls of different entities (“inputs”,“base”, “vectors”,  “outputs”) in a more advanced mode “Functional Model API”.
Maybe a more complicated way makes sense when you do Transfer Learning and want to separate “Base” model vs. rest, but in the HW you need to recreate the full model from scratch ⇒ I believe it is easier to work with a sequence of “similar” layers.

"If you encounter a JSON serialization error during local AWS Lambda testing, you can resolve it by turning the response at `lambda_handler()` into a string by using `str(result)`. This will convert the float32 values into serializable base-Python floats.","This deployment setup can be tested locally using AWS RIE (runtime interface emulator).
Basically, if your Docker image was built upon base AWS Lambda image (FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.10) - just use certain ports for “docker run” and a certain “localhost link” for testing:
docker run -it --rm -p 9000:8080 name
This command runs the image as a container and starts up an endpoint locally at:
localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations
Post an event to the following endpoint using a curl command:
curl -XPOST ""http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations"" -d '{}'

2. If immediate regeneration is not possible, you can try downgrading the protobuf package to version 3.20.x or lower.
3. Another workaround is to set PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python, but this might result in slower parsing.

In this specific case, the issue was resolved by downgrading protobuf to version 3.20.1 using the command:

"After removing docker images, the command that should be run to actually free up space is `docker system prune`.","Problem description
Due to experimenting back and forth so much without care for storage, I just ran out of it on my 30-GB AWS instance.
My first reflex was to remove some zoomcamp directories, but of course those are mostly code so it didn’t help much.

"I recommend putting the pickle-related class into a separate module and importing it in both the script that saves the model and the script that loads the model to avoid the pickle attribute error when using waitress with your Docker container. This error occurs because waitress loads a different module (__main__) than the one used when the model was saved, causing the attribute error. More detailed information can be found in this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27732354/unable-to-load-files-using-pickle-and-multiple-modules.","When running a docker container with waitress serving the app.py for making predictions, pickle will throw an error that can't get attribute <name_of_class> on module __main__.
This does not happen when Flask is used directly, i.e. not through waitress.
The problem is that the model uses a custom column transformer class, and when the model was saved, it was saved from the __main__ module (e.g. python train.py). Pickle will reference the class in the global namespace (top-level code): __main__.<custom_class>.

"The order of multiplication is important in matrix multiplication because changing the order changes the result. For example, when multiplying matrices A and B, the result will be matrix C if multiplied in order A * B, but result will be matrix D if multiplied in order B * A.","When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.
For example:
A (m x n) * B (n x p) = C (m x p)

Abhijit Chakraborty suggested adding the Python311 installation folder to the PATH and restarting the system to fix the docker file rerunning issue on Windows.,"When trying to rerun the docker file in Windows, as opposed to developing in WSL/Linux, I got the error of:
```
Warning: Python 3.11 was not found on your system…
Neither ‘pipenv’ nor ‘asdf’ could be found to install Python.
You can specify specific versions of Python with:
$ pipenv –python path\to\python

"No, it is not always best to train your model only on the most important features. Any feature that can offer additional predictive value should be included in the model. You can predict with and without including a feature to determine its impact on performance. Additionally, some individually important features might be highly correlated with others, so dropping some might be fine. There are different feature selection algorithms available, such as L1 regularization (Lasso), which implicitly does feature selection by shrinking some weights to zero.","I’m just looking back at the lessons in week 3 (churn prediction project), and lesson 3.6 talks about Feature Importance for categorical values. At 8.12, the mutual info scores show that the some features are more important than others, but then in lesson 3.10 the Logistic Regression model is trained on all of the categorical variables (see 1:35). Once we have done feature importance, is it best to train your model only on the most important features?
Not necessarily - rather, any feature that can offer additional predictive value should be included (so, e.g. predict with & without including that feature; if excluding it drops performance, keep it, else drop it). A few individually important features might in fact be highly correlated with others, & dropping some might be fine.

"I'm sorry, there is no specific question mentioned in the provided context to answer.","You can consider several different approaches:
Sampling: In the exploratory phase, you can use random samples of the data.
Chunking: When you do need all the data, you can read and process it in chunks that do fit in the memory.
Optimizing data types: Pandas’ automatic data type inference (when reading data in) might result in e.g. float64 precision being used to represent integers, which wastes space. You might achieve substantial memory reduction by optimizing the data types.
Using Dask, an open-source python project which parallelizes Numpy and Pandas.
